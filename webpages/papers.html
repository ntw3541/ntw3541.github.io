          <strong>Abstract:</strong> This study explores the use of state data 
          sets and meta-analysis of 
          low-powered studies to evaluate a school-based dropout prevention 
          program for students with disabilities. The program was implemented 
          in several states. A randomized controlled trial was infeasible 
          because schools were not chosen at random; furthermore, pretest 
          data were minimal. The use of extant state data allowed these 
          obstacles to be overcome by providing valid pre- and post-intervention 
          outcomes as well as a large selection of schools and variables to 
          create reasonable matches for the treatment schools. Results from 
          four states were synthesized meta-analytically to evaluate whether 
          the program had a significant impact on any of seven proximal and 
          distal outcome variables. No such impacts were demonstrated. More 
          importantly, this paper demonstrates and explains the methodological 
          steps and choices involved in a quasi-experimental evaluation 
          approach that may be applied to cases for which large amounts of 
          extant data are available.</p>

        The Skew of Pathways: The Structural Explanation for the 
        Asian American Academic Achievements
        </p>

        <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper develops a structural explanation for why 1.5 and second generation
        Asian Americans on average have higher academic achievement than white Americans in the United States.
        The paper hypothesizes two pathways to upward mobility in the American job mobility structure: developing
        interpersonal skills to obtain managerial occupations and developing technical skills to obtain
        technical occupations. For Asian immigrant parents, the first pathway is less accessible due to cultural 
        disadvantages in the white American social environment. Meanwhile, the second pathway 
        is more accessible because of insignificant disadvantages in the white American academic 
        environment (especially in the STEM fields). To maximize their childrenâ€™s likelihood of obtaining 
        upward mobility, Asian immigrant parents encourage their children to prioritize time and enegery toward the second pathway. 
        Consequently, 1.5 and 2nd generation Asian 
        Americans have higher academic achievements but lower likelihood to obtain upper-managerial positions 
        than white Americans. This paper suggests that to reduce racial disparities in academic achievements, 
        education institutions and industries should foster "cultural-inclusive environments".
